# Skills-First Principle

## PRINCIPLE

**Before implementing anything, check if a skill or script already exists.**

```yaml
Order:
  1. Read available skills: .cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md
  2. Check if skill covers the task
  3. Use existing skill as-is (don't read internals, just run)
  4. Only implement custom solution if no skill exists

Never:
  - Reinvent what a skill already does
  - Call platform tools (ibcmd, 1cv8) directly when a skill wraps them
  - Read skill internals (bat/ps1) — treat skills as black boxes
```

## CHECKLIST

```yaml
Before writing code that interacts with 1C platform:
  - [ ] Check .cursor/skills/1c-batch/ — covers dump/load config, extensions, EPF
  - [ ] Check .cursor/skills/1c-feature-dev-enhanced/ — covers full dev cycle
  - [ ] Check .cursor/skills/1c-help-mcp/ — covers documentation search
  - [ ] Check .cursor/skills/auto-skill-bootstrap/ — covers skill discovery

Before writing infrastructure scripts:
  - [ ] Check scripts/ folder for existing automation
  - [ ] Check configs/ folder for existing configurations

If skill exists:
  - Use it directly (call the script)
  - Pass parameters as documented in SKILL.md
  - Don't modify the skill — extend via wrapper if needed
```

## ANTI-PATTERN

```yaml
❌ Wrong (reinventing):
  Task: "Dump 1C configuration to XML"
  Action: Write PowerShell calling ibcmd directly
  Result: Cyrillic issues, encoding bugs, wasted tokens

✅ Right (skills-first):
  Task: "Dump 1C configuration to XML"
  Action: .cursor/skills/1c-batch/scripts/dump-config.bat src/cf
  Result: Works immediately, handles encoding internally
```

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Check skills first** — before any implementation
2. **Run, don't read** — treat skill scripts as black boxes
3. **Extend, don't modify** — wrap skills if extra logic needed
4. **Ask user** — if unsure whether a skill covers the task
